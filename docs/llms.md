# LLMs
LLMs (Large Language Models) are a cornerstone of Clara, which is used to analyze and interpret website data retrieved from the user's client (browser). This wiki page will cover which LLMs are used in Clara, how they are used - such as what prompts are used, and how they are compared to each other in terms of performance, usability, and other metrics.
